	<p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.</p>
	<p>
		Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. <cite>Wikipedia</cite>

	GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests.</p>
	<p>
		To sum up the difference between git vs GitHub: git is a local VCS software that enables developers to save snapshots of their projects over time. It's generally best for individual use. GitHub is a web-based platform that incorporates git's version control features so they can be used collaboratively.
